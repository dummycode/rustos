Sharing a stack means the processes would push and pop values to the same stack, including function calls. It is very likely they would crash because after a context switch the second process would be reading the first's contexts values off the stack. The two processes would have to push and pop independently, meaning that once a process resumes execution, the stack must look the same as it did when the process was swapped.
