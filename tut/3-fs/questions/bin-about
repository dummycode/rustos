I chose to implement a bin allocator with bin sizes ranging from 8 bytes to 2^31 bytes. I figured this was a good range because rarely do you need anything smaller than 8 bytes, and the entire system is no more than 2^31 bytes. It handles alignment by only returning blocks that are aligned properly to the user. We could see a lot of internal fragmentation if the user often requests differenly aligned things because they would not align properly to be merged back together.
